# QuantumVITAS

QuantumVITAS (Quantum Visualization Interacting Toolkit for Ab-initio Simulations) is a graphical user interface designed for ab-initio simulation software, and at the moment we are working specifically on using Quantum ESPRESSO as the engine. We want to integrate input file generation, calculation job control, result analysis and data managment into the user interface.

It is a recently started project and **not done yet**, and we are continuously working on it. We expect to offer the first early access version in **mid June**. For more information, feel free check out my [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2e1TWx6DHs) and [development progress video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSX576IHaH0) on my Youtube channel.
